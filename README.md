## Usage

1. Register nodepay account first, if you dont have you can register [here](https://app.nodepay.ai/register), I recomended to `download extension`, `activate your account`, complete the `Proof of Humanhood` and `connect your wallet` first before running the script because this important for `Nodepay TGE`.
2. Set and Modify `user.txt` before running the script. Below how to setup this file, put your np_token in the text file, example below:
   ```
   eyJhbGcixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   eyJ23wixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
To get your token, follow this step:
- Login to your grass account in https://app.nodepay.ai/dashboard, make sure you is in this link before go to next step
- Go to inspect element, press F12 or right-click then pick inspect element in your browser
- Go to application tab - look for Local Storage in storage list -> click `https://app.nodepay.ai` and you will see your np_token.
- or you can go Console tab and paste This.
  ```bash
  localStorage.getItem('np_token')
  ```
3. If you want to use proxy, edit the `proxy.txt` with your proxy.

   ```
   ip:port
   username:password@ip:port
   http://ip:port
   http://username:password@ip:port
   socks5://ip:port
   socks5://username:password@ip:port
   ```

5. Run the script:
	```bash
	python main.py
	```
6. When running the script, answer if you want to use proxy and how much proxy you want to use, it will look like this:
   ```
   Do you want to use proxies? (y/n):
   ```

   ```
   How many proxies per account do you want to use?:
   ```
